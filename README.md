Generic Embedded Peripherals
============================

Project Details
---------------

* Authors: Craig Comberbach
* Processor: 
* Version Control: This code uses Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/). The code is setup to auto handle changes to source files it depends upon as long as the associated *.h file has the *_MAJOR, *_MINOR, and _PATCH definitions updated every time the file version changes.

This code is not written to be used standalone, but rather is used with another project that requires the functionality provided with these files. Generic functionality to modules or connected peripherals is all that should be in this project.
